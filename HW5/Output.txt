Output:
Age Bin Name: 0.1-7.0  Count: 252
Age Bin Name: 8.0-26.0  Count: 111
{'min_sup': 0.1, 'min_conf': 0.85, 'min_lift': 4}
total rules: 42


Approaches:
1: data preprocessing
1.1 Gram_ID use values Positive/Negative , we should transform it to True and False.
1.2 there is something we need to fix: Sex have some error, fix it
    (not necessary due to Association Rules is not sensitive to outliers, but fix it is fine ).
1.3:Discretize Age values with K-Means. We categorize it into 2 clusters.
    And for better understand and easier to use, we use age range to name each age bin.
    Drop Age column

2:use get_dummies to get a dataframe with a "Tabular Data" format

2:use for loop to iterate all the possible values of hyperparameter.

3:using the criteria 20 <= high_lift_rules_df.shape[0] <= 50 to find the combination of hyperparameters.

4:save the rules to csv file.
